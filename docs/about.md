# About

Hi, my name is Mathias. I am a Business Engineer by trade, but developped a passion for data and the link with business. My experience can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcreemers/).

I have > 10+ years of experience in complex retail supply chains and related data projects. I am a business user at heart, that likes to help serve individuals and companies quickly access, use and extract information from their data.

I have experience in building an industrialized data solution, but my speciality comes in bootstrap, low-budget or proof of concept situations. Situations where teams are responsible for the full scope of ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) to the data valorization behind.

The applications are broad : 

- Building POC to get budgets for industrialized data solutions
- Launch of new warehouses, processes or work organizations that have new and undocumented data and reporting needs
